This is the method for making jelly:
i. Take the premix and regulator in a large glass bowl and thoroughly mix the two powders. Ignore any lumps that may be formed.
ii. Take 500ml(3 cups) of water and bring it to a boil. Let it cool for one minute.
iii. Add the water to the bowl and mix the powder with the water until it is dissolved completely.
iv. Pour into a jelly mould and let it rest at room temperature for 45 minutes.
v. When the jelly is set, remove it from the mould and serve. Enjoy!
